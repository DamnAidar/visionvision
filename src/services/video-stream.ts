 * This file previously contained interfaces and functions for a simulated UDP video stream.
 * Since the application now uses the browser's `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
 * to access the live camera feed directly in the frontend, the backend stream simulation
 * is no longer needed for the core video display functionality.
 *
 * Object detection processing, if implemented later, might involve sending frames
 * from the frontend to a backend service, but the initial stream capture is handled client-side.
